FuelTypes
>> Fuel Type  BaseFuel  		Age Range	Species
>> ---------  --------     		---------	----------
      2		Conifer				0 to 40		abiesibi piceobov pinusibi    		<<C2: boreal spruce (young). Likely only the dominant fuel type on a small proportion of cells because most dark con forests tend teoward multi-aged or uneven-aged
	  3		Conifer				41 to 280	abiesibi piceobov pinusibi			<<C2: mature, moderately-stocked black spruce analog, but not present on sphagnum surface.
      5 	Conifer				0 to 40		pinusylv larisibi					<<C4: immature pine and larch, likely to regenerate at high stand densities following fire. Siberian pine removed from this category now that a separate young dark conifer class exists
	  8 	Conifer				41 to 300	pinusylv larisibi					<<C7: could go either way, but the structure and fire resistance in Scots pine / larch forests is Siberia is more consistent with open or semi-open PIPO and interior PSME stands (C7)
      9 	Deciduous 			0 to 30	    betupend poputrem					<<D1: young deciduous, broad-leaved. Research on aspen in Canada indicates some size-related trends in mortality, even at relatively low intensities, hence creation of separate fuel classes for young and mature birch/aspen
	  10	Deciduous 			31 to 120	betupend poputrem					<<D1: old, deciduous, broad-leaved trees
	  11	Deciduous			0 to 120	betunana alnufrut salixspp			<<D1: all shrubs assumed to have low fire tolerance, primarily due to small diameter and low bark thickness, but leaves have low flammability
	  19	Open				0 to 500	sphagnum							<<O-1a: model sphagnum as matted grass
	  20	Open				0 to 500	genegrss groundveg					<<O-1b: model genegrss and groundveg as standing grass. Could adjust percent curing to reduce peak growing season flamability
